//! # `minwindef.h` macros for use in Rust with the windows-rs and windows-sys crates
//! This module defines equivalents to the macros defined in Include/&lt;version&gt;/shared/minwindef.h
//! as part of the Windows SDK. These macros serve to (un)pack numeric values into and from larger
//! numeric types.
//!
//! Besides the existing `#define`s, this module adds a couple functions useful for those working
//! with 64-bit integers and pointers:
//! - [`lodword`] and [`hidword`] to get the lower and higher 32 bits from them
//! - [`makelonglong`] to pack two 32-bit ints into a 64-bit int.
//! These were added because they're needed for working with e.g. `CreateFileMapping*` functions.
//!
//! Lastly some additional methods were added for splitting and returning both values at once.
//! Consider them syntactical sugar over the others, as that really is all they are.
//! They just return a tuple containing (in order) the low order and high order components. This
//! is achieved by just calling both of those functions one after the other.
//! ```
//! use windows_ext::minwindef::*;
//! // existing minwindef.h macros:
//! let full: u32 = 9548625;
//! let lo1 = loword(full);
//! let hi1 = hiword(full);
//!
//! // convenience wrapper:
//! let full: u32 = 9548625;
//! let (lo2, hi2) = splitdword(full);
//! assert_eq!(lo1, lo2);
//! assert_eq!(hi1, hi2);
//! ```
