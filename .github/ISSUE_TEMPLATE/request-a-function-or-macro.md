**Function or macro that's missing**
Its name, what it's for and if possible where in the headers the definition is.

**Did you check if it's an alias or a macro defined as calling other macros?**
If it is, you can (at least for now) do the same. Maybe even make your own version of it (and please do PR it in if you do) to work around the limitation.

**Additional context**
Anything that'd be useful to know like error cases and possible pitfalls with using it would be much appreciated.
